# ExamProject.1st-semester

This is a Responsive Experience website for hidden places in HÃ¸jbjerg, Aarhus

With this website I attempted to solve the problem among the young generation who, based on the research, do not engage with nature enough despite the fact that they want to. The idea was to make them feel motivated, go and spend some time outside in nature with friends and people who share the same desire, age, thoughts.
